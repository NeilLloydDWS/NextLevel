# NextLevel Multi-Camera Independent Configuration Analysis

## Current Capability Assessment

Based on the analysis of NextLevel's multi-camera implementation, **you currently CANNOT independently configure cameras** for different capture modes or settings. The system does not support your use case of:
- 4K video recording on one back camera
- HD image capture on another back camera

## Current Limitations

### 1. Single Configuration for All Cameras
- All cameras share the same `videoConfiguration` and `photoConfiguration`
- Cannot set different resolutions per camera (e.g., 4K on one, HD on another)
- Cannot set different frame rates per camera
- Cannot mix capture modes (video vs photo) between cameras

### 2. Capture Mode Restrictions
```swift
public enum NextLevelCaptureMode {
    case video
    case photo
    case multiCamera  // All cameras must be in same mode
}
```
When using `.multiCamera` mode, all cameras operate in video capture mode. There's no built-in support for simultaneous video and photo capture.

### 3. Shared Settings Apply to All Cameras
The following settings from your app apply globally to all cameras:
- **Resolution preset**: Same for all cameras (cannot do 4K + HD simultaneously)
- **FPS**: Same frame rate for all cameras
- **Video stabilization mode**: Applied uniformly
- **Aspect ratio**: Single setting for all outputs
- **Exposure**: Shared exposure configuration
- **Video/audio bitrate**: Same encoding settings

### 4. Limited Camera Selection
While you can specify camera positions (back/front), you cannot:
- Use multiple cameras from the same position (e.g., wide + ultra-wide back cameras)
- Configure lens type independently per camera in multi-camera mode

## What IS Possible

### 1. Simultaneous Recording
- Record from 2 cameras simultaneously (typically back + front)
- Choose recording output mode:
  - Separate files per camera
  - Combined (picture-in-picture or side-by-side)
  - Custom composition

### 2. Basic Multi-Camera Setup
```swift
let multiCameraConfig = NextLevelMultiCameraConfiguration()
multiCameraConfig.primaryCameraPosition = .back
multiCameraConfig.secondaryCameraPosition = .front
multiCameraConfig.preferredFrameRate = 30
multiCameraConfig.videoStabilizationMode = .auto
multiCameraConfig.outputMode = .separate

nextLevel.multiCameraConfiguration = multiCameraConfig
nextLevel.captureMode = .multiCamera
```

### 3. Thermal Management
The system automatically adjusts quality based on device temperature:
- Reduces frame rates when device heats up
- Disables secondary cameras if needed
- Falls back to single camera in extreme cases

## Alternative Approaches

To achieve your goal of 4K video + HD photo capture, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Sequential Capture
- Configure for 4K video recording first
- Switch to photo mode for HD capture when needed
- Cannot be simultaneous but provides full control

### 2. Video Frame Extraction
- Record 4K video
- Extract HD frames as "photos" during or after recording
- Provides pseudo-simultaneous capture

### 3. Custom Implementation
Would require significant modifications to NextLevel:
- Modify capture session configuration per input
- Create separate output configurations per camera
- Handle synchronization and resource management

## Technical Requirements for Independent Configuration

To support independent camera configurations, NextLevel would need:

1. **Per-Camera Configuration Objects**
```swift
struct CameraConfiguration {
    let position: NextLevelDevicePosition
    let lensType: NextLevelLensType
    let captureMode: NextLevelCaptureMode
    let videoSettings: NextLevelVideoConfiguration?
    let photoSettings: NextLevelPhotoConfiguration?
}
```

2. **Modified Session Setup**
- Configure each camera input independently
- Add appropriate outputs per camera
- Manage resource constraints

3. **API Changes**
- Replace single configuration with array/dictionary of configurations
- Provide per-camera control methods
- Handle mixed-mode capture logic

## Conclusion

The current NextLevel multi-camera implementation is designed for synchronized capture with uniform settings across all cameras. It does not support the independent configuration needed for simultaneous 4K video and HD photo capture on different cameras. 

Your use case would require either:
1. Using NextLevel in single-camera mode and switching between configurations
2. Implementing significant modifications to support per-camera configurations
3. Using a different capture approach (like frame extraction from video)
